# E-Commerce--Data-Analysis-With-Python-Pandas

## E-Commerce Data Analysis Project
### Overview
Welcome to the E-Commerce Data Analysis Project, where I demonstrate my data analysis skills using Python and Pandas. As an aspiring Business Analyst, I created this project to showcase my ability to work with real-world datasets, extract insights, and solve practical business-related questions. This project is designed to highlight my technical expertise and problem-solving skills to recruiters and hiring managers.

The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle and contains customer purchase information, including columns like Email, Job Title, Purchase Price, Credit Card Provider, IP Address, and more. The aim is to answer specific business-related questions and demonstrate various data manipulation and exploration techniques using Python Pandas.
